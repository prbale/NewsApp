## About

It loads the news articles using [news api](https://newsapi.org/). Using retrofit we fetch all the json data provided by the api and display on the user screen.

## Built With ðŸ› 
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - Programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
    - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
    - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
    - [ViewDataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.

- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
